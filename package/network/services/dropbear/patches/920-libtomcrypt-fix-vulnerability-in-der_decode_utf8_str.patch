Subject: [PATCH] libtomcrypt: fix vulnerability in der_decode_utf8_string
 CVE-2019-17362
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ cherry pick of upstream commit 64d1153e5a515740ab56f39c46baf4cf6991a9d3 ]

The der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does
not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences.  This allows
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via
carefully crafted DER-encoded data.

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be able to provide
crafted DER-encoded data to LibTomCrypt (e.g. by importing a X509
certificate).  Information disclosure is made possible by a 2-steps
attack where the imported data is later somehow re-encoded and sent to
the attacker (e.g. import and then export X509 certificate).
